# Hospital-Analysis
Analyzed hospital admission records using Power BI to uncover actionable insights on medication usage, doctor performance, and common health conditions.

# 🏥 Hospital Analytics Dashboard – Power BI

## 📌 Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing hospital operations using real patient data to uncover medical trends, financial performance, and patient demographics. Using Power BI, I developed three dynamic dashboards to assist hospital management in making informed decisions related to patient care, medication, and financial sustainability.

The analysis explores how patient profiles, disease types, and treatment costs impact hospital performance — with clear, data-driven recommendations for resource planning and service improvement.

## 🎯 Project Aim

To generate actionable insights across three key areas:
- Medical trends and disease occurrences
- Financial performance of treatments and services
- Patient demographics and admission behavior

## 🗂️ Project Description

This project includes three main dashboards:

### 1. **Medical Overview**
- Identifies the most common conditions (e.g., Arthritis, Obesity)
- Tracks prescription trends (Paracetamol, Lipitor, etc.)
- Shows test result distribution (Normal vs Abnormal)

### 2. **Financial Performance Insight**
- Reveals which diseases cost the most to treat
- Shows revenue trends based on treatment type
- Highlights patient groups contributing to higher financial returns

### 3. **Patient Insights**
- Visualizes admission patterns by age, gender, and blood group
- Analyzes emergency vs scheduled admission trends


Together, these dashboards support better planning, resource allocation, and patient care.

 Data Cleaning and Transformation

- Loaded dataset using Power BI's **Get Data** option
- Used **Power Query** to clean and reshape
  - Renamed ambiguous columns
  - Standardized age groups and disease names
- Created new columns for grouping and comparison

Key Insights

🔹 Paracetamol was the most prescribed medication   
🔹 Lipitor usage linked to Obesity prevalence   
🔹 Patients aged **71+** had the highest admission rate (21.88%)  
🔹 **Arthritis** was the most treated condition (16.77%)  
🔹 **Obesity** caused the most emergency cases (17.11%)  
🔹 Most test results were **abnormal**, suggesting late diagnoses  
🔹 **Blood group A-** was the most common (12.56%) which is useful for inventory

##  Recommendations

1. Stock high-demand medications like Paracetamol and Lipitor
2. Launch obesity awareness and intervention programs
3. Prepare geriatric services for the 71+ age group
4. Improve early screening to reduce abnormal test rates
5. Plan blood inventory based on blood group distribution trends
